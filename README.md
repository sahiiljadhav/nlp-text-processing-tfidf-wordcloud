# NLP Text Processing with TF-IDF and WordCloud

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a complete NLP pipeline, including text preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and WordCloud generation. The project is designed to help users understand how to process text data, extract meaningful features, and visualize word frequencies.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
- **TF-IDF Calculation**: Compute Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to understand the importance of words in a document.
- **WordCloud Generation**: Visualize the most frequent words in a text corpus using a WordCloud.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib
